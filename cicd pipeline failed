    We had a CI/CD pipeline failure during a production deployment for a fintech service where the Logstash component stopped ingesting logs post-deploy. The pipeline was triggered via GitHub Actions, deploying Docker containers to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

    I noticed the failure through Prometheus alerts and missing logs in Elasticsearch, which immediately flagged a visibility gap. I checked the Helm deployment history and saw that the new config map had a syntax error â€” it was pushed without validation due to a missing linting step in the pipeline.

    To restore service, I rolled back the Helm release to the previous stable version using helm rollback, and re-tagged the Docker image to match the last known good state. I also re-enabled log ingestion and confirmed recovery via Grafana dashboards and smoke tests.

    Post-incident, I updated the pipeline to include config validation using helm lint, added a pre-deploy dry-run stage, and enforced manual approval for critical services. I documented the RCA in our SMAX portal with clear logs and recovery steps to ensure transparency and prevent recurrence.
