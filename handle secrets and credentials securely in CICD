"Yeah, so... handling secrets in CI/CD — I try to be really careful with that. Uh, in most cases I use environment variables, like in GitHub Actions or Jenkins. I store them encrypted, and then reference them in the pipeline so they don’t show up in logs. Although... I think once I accidentally echoed a secret in a debug log — not ideal, but I caught it before it went to production."

"For more sensitive stuff, I’ve used AWS Secrets Manager and Vault. I usually integrate them using IAM roles, but I’ve messed up the permissions a couple of times — like, the pipeline couldn’t access the secret and I spent way too long figuring out it was just a missing policy."

"I also avoid hardcoding secrets in scripts — I mean, I did that once early on, just for testing, and forgot to remove it before pushing. Learned my lesson there. Now I always double-check before commits."

"And yeah, I try to rotate credentials regularly, though I’ll admit I’ve missed a few scheduled rotations when things got busy. I’ve started setting reminders for that now."

"Overall, I just try to keep it simple, secure, and make sure secrets don’t leak into logs or error messages. If something goes wrong, I document it and fix the process so it doesn’t happen again."
