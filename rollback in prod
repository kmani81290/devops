    “In production, I handle rollback by keeping deployments version-controlled and reversible. For example, with Kubernetes, I use Helm to manage releases — so if something breaks, I can quickly run helm rollback to revert to the previous stable version.

    I always tag Docker images and maintain release history in Docker Hub, so I know exactly which version to redeploy. Infrastructure changes are managed through Terraform, and I use state files and versioned modules to roll back safely.

    I also monitor post-deployment health using Prometheus and Grafana, and if alerts fire or smoke tests fail, I trigger rollback immediately. The goal is to minimize downtime and restore service fast — ideally within minutes.

    I document every rollback with RCA-ready logs using Logstash and Elasticsearch, so the team can learn and improve from each incident.”
